          <p>
            I have built my career in finance and business operations, working
            close to real processes, constraints and decision-making environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout this journey, data analysis has always been a central
            element of my work — from financial reporting and operational
            monitoring to identifying patterns, inconsistencies and risks that
            directly impact business performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, I started using technology and data-driven tools as
            practical instruments to improve control, efficiency and
            reliability — not as an end in themselves, but as a way to support
            clearer and more informed decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy working with code and building solutions, even though I do not rely on
            memorizing syntax. I use documentation, references and AI-assisted tools as
            part of a conscious development process, focusing on structure, logic and
            validation rather than speed or volume of code.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am not focused on writing code or building models for their own
            sake. I focus on transforming data into clarity, automating what
            should be automated, and ensuring that every solution remains
            understandable, auditable and aligned with real business needs.
